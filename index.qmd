# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is for those who made a nice shiny app and want to share it with the maximum amount of people possible. We aim to answer the following:

> Given a fixed amount of hardware serving the shiny app (say, 2 cores) and a fixed amount of hardware serving an optional API backend (say, 4 cores), how many people can access a shiny app and have a good experience? Can we make it to a thousand?

Creating a shiny app is easy, but serving it to dozens of people and assuring that all have a good experience... that can be a little more complicated.

In this book, we will show in practice how some techniques can be used to improve performance.
